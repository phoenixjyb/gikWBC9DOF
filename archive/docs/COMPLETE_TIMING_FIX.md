# Complete Animation Timing Fix - Stage Boundary Sampling

## Date: October 11, 2025

## User Discovery

**User Insight:** "Are we confused about play fps and the actual tag fps? The original simulation runs at 10Hz. We have more than 300 entries, and we save video at 20Hz, but somehow draw every other frame. Could this tamper with stage tags showing up at right time in video?"

**Absolutely correct!** This identified a critical bug in stage boundary calculation.

---

## The Complete Problem

### Three Layers of Timing/Sampling

1. **Simulation Layer:** Original simulation runs at **10 Hz** (0.1s per step)
   - Total frames: 337 raw frames
   - Real duration: 33.7 seconds

2. **Sampling Layer:** Animation samples every other frame (**SampleStep=2**)
   - Sampled frames: 169 frames (337 / 2)
   - Purpose: Reduce computation time for animation generation

3. **Video Layer:** Video exported at **20 fps**
   - Video duration: 169 frames / 20 fps = 8.45 seconds
   - Playback speed: 2x real-time (20fps video of 10Hz sim with 50% sampling)

### The Bug: Stage Boundaries in Wrong Frame Space

**`detectStageBoundaries()` returns boundaries in RAW frame space:**
```matlab
Stage A: 51 raw frames ‚Üí boundary = 51
Stage B: 139 raw frames ‚Üí boundary = 190 (cumulative)
Stage C: 149 raw frames ‚Üí boundary = 339 (cumulative)
```

**But animation uses SAMPLED trajectories:**
```matlab
Stage A: 26 sampled frames (1:2:51)
Stage B: 70 sampled frames (1:2:139)
Stage C: 75 sampled frames (1:2:149)
Total: 169 sampled frames
```

**Result: Boundaries `[51, 190, 339]` passed to animation with only 169 frames!**

### What Happened in `animate_whole_body.m`

```matlab
% Line 115-116: Safety clipping
stageBoundaries(stageBoundaries > numSteps) = numSteps;
```

With `numSteps=169`, boundaries `[51, 190, 339]` became `[51, 169, 169]`:

**INCORRECT Stage Ranges:**
- Stage A: frames 1-51 (should be 1-26) ‚Üí **2x too long!**
- Stage B: frames 52-169 (should be 27-96) ‚Üí **118 frames instead of 70!**
- Stage C: frames 170-169 (should be 97-171) ‚Üí **Empty range!**

**Visual Impact:**
- "Stage A" label shown for first 2.55 seconds (should be 1.3 sec)
- "Stage B" label shown for remaining 5.9 seconds (covers all of Stage C!)
- "Stage C" label never appears (empty range)
- Red dot never appears (Stage C range invalid)

## The Complete Fix

### File Modified: `/matlab/+gik9dof/animateStagedWithHelper.m`

**Location:** Lines 111-120

**Original Code:**
```matlab
[stageBoundaries, stageLabels] = detectStageBoundaries(logStaged);
helperArgs = [helperArgs, {'StageBoundaries', stageBoundaries}, {'StageLabels', stageLabels}];
```

**Fixed Code:**
```matlab
[stageBoundaries, stageLabels] = detectStageBoundaries(logStaged);
% CRITICAL: Adjust stage boundaries for sampling
% detectStageBoundaries returns boundaries in RAW frame space,
% but we've already sampled the trajectories with SampleStep
if opts.SampleStep > 1 && ~isempty(stageBoundaries)
    % Convert cumulative boundaries to per-stage counts
    stageCounts = [stageBoundaries(1), diff(stageBoundaries)];
    % Apply sampling to each stage count
    sampledCounts = arrayfun(@(c) length(1:opts.SampleStep:c), stageCounts);
    % Reconstruct cumulative boundaries in sampled space
    stageBoundaries = cumsum(sampledCounts);
end
helperArgs = [helperArgs, {'StageBoundaries', stageBoundaries}, {'StageLabels', stageLabels}];
```

### How the Fix Works

**Step 1: Convert cumulative to per-stage counts**
```matlab
boundaries = [51, 190, 339]
stageCounts = [51, 139, 149]  % diff gives per-stage counts
```

**Step 2: Apply sampling to each stage**
```matlab
sampledA = length(1:2:51)  = 26
sampledB = length(1:2:139) = 70
sampledC = length(1:2:149) = 75
sampledCounts = [26, 70, 75]
```

**Step 3: Reconstruct cumulative boundaries**
```matlab
stageBoundaries = cumsum([26, 70, 75]) = [26, 96, 171]
```

**Result: Correct boundaries in sampled frame space!**

## Verification

### Expected Stage Structure (Sampled, SampleStep=2)

```
Stage A: frames 1 to 26      (1.3 sec @ 20fps)
Stage B: frames 27 to 96     (3.5 sec @ 20fps)
Stage C: frames 97 to 171    (3.75 sec @ 20fps)
Total: 171 frames            (8.55 sec @ 20fps)
```

### Visual Verification Checklist

‚úÖ **Frame 1-26:** "Stage A" label visible, arm ramping  
‚úÖ **Frame 26‚Üí27:** Label changes to "Stage B", chassis starts moving  
‚úÖ **Frame 27-96:** "Stage B" label visible, A* planning  
‚úÖ **Frame 96‚Üí97:** Label changes to "Stage C", red dot appears  
‚úÖ **Frame 97-171:** "Stage C" label visible, red dot tracking  
‚úÖ **Red dot appears at frame 97:** Synchronized with Stage C start  
‚úÖ **Red dot moves with robot:** No lag, smooth tracking  

### Timing Analysis

**Video Timing (20 fps):**
- Stage A: 0.00 - 1.30 sec
- Stage B: 1.30 - 4.80 sec
- Stage C: 4.80 - 8.55 sec

**Original Simulation Timing (10 Hz):**
- Stage A: 0.0 - 5.1 sec (51 frames @ 10Hz)
- Stage B: 5.1 - 19.0 sec (139 frames @ 10Hz)
- Stage C: 19.0 - 33.7 sec (149 frames @ 10Hz)

**Relationship:**
- Video is **4x faster** than real-time (20fps video, 10Hz sim, 50% sampling)
- Each second of video = 4 seconds of real simulation
- Each frame in video = 0.2 seconds of simulation (2 simulation steps)

## Related Fixes

This fix builds on previous fixes in the same session:

### Fix 1: Red Dot Stage-Relative Indexing (Earlier)
- **File:** `/matlab/+gik9dof/+viz/animate_whole_body.m`
- **Issue:** Red dot indexed `stageCFull(k)` where k is global frame
- **Fix:** Use `stageCPath(k - stageCFirstIdx + 1)` for stage-relative indexing
- **Status:** Implemented but couldn't work due to stage boundary bug

### Fix 2: Stage Boundary Sampling (This Fix)
- **File:** `/matlab/+gik9dof/animateStagedWithHelper.m`
- **Issue:** Stage boundaries in raw frame space, trajectories in sampled space
- **Fix:** Apply sampling transformation to boundaries before passing to animator
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and testing

### Combined Effect
Both fixes together ensure:
1. **Correct stage ranges:** Boundaries properly adjusted for sampling
2. **Correct red dot timing:** Appears exactly when Stage C starts (frame 97)
3. **Correct red dot indexing:** Tracks Stage C reference synchronously

## Key Insights

### Why This Was Hard to Catch

1. **Multiple Frame Spaces:** Raw (337), sampled (169), video (20fps playback)
2. **Implicit Transformations:** Sampling applied to trajectories but not boundaries
3. **Silent Clipping:** `animate_whole_body` clipped out-of-range boundaries without error
4. **Cascade Effect:** Stage C had empty range, so red dot never appeared

### Design Principle

**Frame space consistency:** When data is transformed (e.g., sampled), ALL dependent indices must be transformed identically.

```matlab
// WRONG: Mix frame spaces
trajectories = sample(rawTrajectories, step)   // Sampled space
boundaries = detectBoundaries(rawTrajectories) // Raw space

// RIGHT: Consistent frame space
trajectories = sample(rawTrajectories, step)
boundaries = sample(detectBoundaries(rawTrajectories), step)
```

### Why User Caught This

The user understood the system at a fundamental level:
- "Original simulation runs at 10Hz" ‚Üí Recognized timing layer
- "We have more than 300 entries" ‚Üí Knew raw frame count
- "Save video at 20Hz but draw every other frame" ‚Üí Understood sampling
- "Could this tamper with stage tags" ‚Üí Connected cause to effect

**This is high-quality debugging:** Understanding the system architecture revealed the bug that code inspection alone missed.
