Priority 1: Fix the "Lazy Base" Behavior (Cost Function Tuning)
The most critical issue is the robot's tendency to saturate its arm joints instead of moving its base. This is caused by incorrect cost function weights. The goal is to make base movement "cheaper" for the optimizer than arm movement.

### 1. Invert the Input Weights
The current weights heavily penalize base movement, making it 100-1000x more expensive than arm movement. Reverse this logic.

Action: Modify the weights section in your pipeline_profiles.yaml file.

Before:

YAML

# pipeline_profiles.yaml -> pureMPC -> stage_c -> nmpc -> weights
weights:
  position: 100.0
  orientation: 50.0
  input_v: 1.0          # High cost
  input_omega: 10.0       # Very high cost
  input_arm: 0.01         # Very low cost
After (Recommended):

YAML

# pipeline_profiles.yaml -> pureMPC -> stage_c -> nmpc -> weights
weights:
  position: 100.0
  orientation: 50.0
  input_v: 0.1          # DECREASED: Make forward motion cheap
  input_omega: 0.5        # DECREASED: Make turning cheap
  input_arm: 1.0          # INCREASED: Make arm motion expensive
  rate_v: 0.2             # Adjust proportionally
  rate_omega: 1.0         # Adjust proportionally
  rate_arm: 0.5           # Adjust proportionally
  terminal: 5.0
### 2. Activate Arm Posture Regularization
Your cost function eeTrackingCostFcn.m already includes code for posture regularization, which is essential for discouraging awkward arm poses. You need to activate it in your configuration.

Action: Add the arm_posture weight to your pipeline_profiles.yaml file.

YAML

# In pureMPC -> stage_c -> nmpc -> weights
weights:
  # ... (all weights from above) ...
  terminal: 5.0
  
  # ADD THE FOLLOWING LINES:
  arm_posture: 0.05       # Penalize deviation from a nominal pose (e.g., home)
  # arm_nominal: [0, -1.57, 1.57, 0, 0, 0] # Optional: specify a non-zero nominal pose
✅ Priority 2: Improve the Slow Solve Time
After fixing the robot's behavior, address the controller's speed.

### 1. Temporarily Shorten the MPC Horizons
A long prediction horizon (p=10) increases the complexity of the optimization problem. Reduce it temporarily to see if you can achieve real-time performance, then increase it again later.

Action: Modify the horizon lengths in pipeline_profiles.yaml.

Before:

YAML

# In pureMPC -> stage_c -> nmpc
nmpc:
  horizon: 10
  control_horizon: 5
After (Recommended for Testing):

YAML

# In pureMPC -> stage_c -> nmpc
nmpc:
  horizon: 5           # REDUCED
  control_horizon: 2   # REDUCED
### 2. Ensure Custom Constraints Remain Disabled
Your observation in runStageCPureMPC.m is correct: using CustomIneqConFcn for the wheel speed constraint significantly slows down the solver. The standard MV (Manipulated Variable) limits on v and omega are much faster and usually sufficient.

Action: Confirm that the line assigning nlobj.Optimization.CustomIneqConFcn in runStageCPureMPC.m remains commented out.

Matlab

% This line should remain commented out for better performance
% nlobj.Optimization.CustomIneqConFcn = @(X,U,e,data) ...
%     gik9dof.mpc.wheelSpeedConstraints(X, U, e, data, constraintParams);
✅ Priority 3: Verification and Refinement
Once the controller is behaving correctly and running fast, verify the implementation for robustness.

### 1. Validate Your Analytical Jacobians
A bug in a Jacobian is a common and difficult-to-find issue. Use MATLAB's built-in validation tool to check your analytical gradients against a numerical approximation.

Action: Add the validateFcns command to runStageCPureMPC.m after you have fully configured the nlobj.

Matlab

% In runStageCPureMPC.m, after setting all properties of nlobj
% ...
nlobj.Optimization.SolverOptions.ConstraintTolerance = constraintTol;

if verbose
    fprintf(\'  NMPC controller created.\\n\');

    % ADD THIS VALIDATION BLOCK
    fprintf(\'Step 2a: Validating custom MPC functions...\\n\');
    validateFcns(nlobj, x_current, u_last);
    fprintf(\'  Validation complete.\\n\');
end
