# Codex Outlook on Project Pipeline

## Executive Findings
- The narrative in `docs/projectAnalysis.md` accurately mirrors the implemented pipeline: the same hand-offs between ingestion, staged control, logging, and animation are visible in the MATLAB sources.
- No contradictions were detected between the documented data flow and the current code; helper scripts continue to consume the staged log in the ways described.
- Observed opportunities centre on traceability extras (e.g., richer metadata around Reeds–Shepp refinements) rather than correcting factual gaps.

## Alignment Checkpoints

### Ingestion & Environment Configuration
- `gik9dof.environmentConfig` seeds the base pose, distance margins, and populates the second obstacle from waypoint 112 in the JSON (`matlab/+gik9dof/environmentConfig.m:21-45`), matching the ingestion summary.
- `gik9dof.trackReferenceTrajectory` loads the URDF, expands floor discs into distance specs, and returns the solver bundle before optionally delegating to the staged pipeline (`matlab/+gik9dof/trackReferenceTrajectory.m:81-234`).

### Staged Control Pipeline
- Stage A locks the base bounds and records `stageA.qTraj` using `runTrajectoryControl` (`matlab/+gik9dof/runStagedTrajectory.m:118-148`), as described.
- Stage B supports both the GIK-in-loop flow and the Hybrid-A*/pure pursuit branch; the implementation logs planner states, command tables, and docking metrics exactly as the document claims (`matlab/+gik9dof/runStagedTrajectory.m:150-338`).
- Stage C first regenerates the reference ribbon, runs chassis simulation via `control.simulateChassisExecution`, and feeds executed base states back into a locked-base GIK solve (`matlab/+gik9dof/runStagedTrajectory.m:340-446`).
- Shared instrumentation inside `runTrajectoryControl` stores `qTraj`, end-effector poses, and tracking error vectors that downstream plots and animations rely on (`matlab/+gik9dof/runTrajectoryControl.m:230-332`).

### Logging & Artifact Capture
- `gik9dof.runStagedReference` clones the environment, pipes options through to `trackReferenceTrajectory`, and persists `log_staged_<mode>.mat` alongside the environment snapshot (`matlab/+gik9dof/runStagedReference.m:1-210`).
- The staged log structure contains `stageLogs`, distance specs, alignment info, and planner diagnostics (`matlab/+gik9dof/runStagedTrajectory.m:423-480`), aligning with the documentation.

### Visualisation & Export
- `gik9dof.animateStagedWithHelper` resamples the staged log, prioritises Stage C reference paths, and forwards obstacles and stage boundaries to the visualiser (`matlab/+gik9dof/animateStagedWithHelper.m:1-185`).
- `gik9dof.viz.animate_whole_body` consumes the sampled `qTraj` and overlay data to render reviews, while scripts such as `generate_animation_from_saved_log` wrap the process for analysts (`matlab/+gik9dof/+viz/animate_whole_body.m:1-220`, `generate_animation_from_saved_log.m:1-70`).
- `scripts/analysis/DATA_FLOW_ANALYSIS.m` confirms that animations use executed joint trajectories for rendering and JSON targets for the Stage C reference, echoing the clarification in the project analysis.

## Observed Follow-Ups
- Consider appending a lightweight index of diagnostic tables (e.g., where RS acceptance metrics or cloth refinement logs reside) to `projectAnalysis.md` for faster cross-navigation.
- A short appendix on how `results/<timestamp>` folders are organised—beyond the MAT log—could help reviewers trace inputs to generated MP4s when multiple studies run in parallel.
