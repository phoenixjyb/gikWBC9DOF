## Merge Recommendations

### Option 1: Merge origin/main INTO codegencc45 (Recommended)

**Why**: Keep your 20-constraint work and add the simulation updates.

**Impact**:
- ✅ Keep all your GIK 20-constraint work
- ✅ Keep all ROS2 integration 
- ✅ Keep deployment tooling
- ✅ Add updated simulation orchestration
- ✅ Add new top-level run scripts
- ⚠️ May have conflicts in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`

**Command**:
```powershell
git merge origin/main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git commit
```

**Potential Conflicts**:
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Both branches modified
- Simulation scripts (if you've touched them in your branch)

---

### Option 2: Cherry-pick specific commits from origin/main

**Why**: Only take what you need without full merge.

**Commands**:
```powershell
# Get backup trajectory
git cherry-pick f1f121f

# Get simulation updates (may need conflict resolution)
git cherry-pick 564f82d
```

---

### Option 3: Keep branches separate for now

**Why**: Your branch is focused on ROS2/20-constraints; main is focused on simulation.

**When to merge**: After testing 20-constraint solver on hardware.

## Detailed File-by-File Analysis

### Files Modified in BOTH Branches:
- **None directly conflicting** - Your work is in ROS2/codegen, theirs is in simulation

### Files Modified ONLY in origin/main:
1. `1_pull_world_scaled.json` - Reference trajectory update
2. `1_pull_world_scaled.json-bak.json` - NEW backup
3. `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Documentation update
4. `matlab/+gik9dof/control/purePursuitFollower.m` - Minor updates
5. `matlab/+gik9dof/animateStagedWithHelper.m` - Updates
6. `matlab/+gik9dof/runStagedReference.m` - NEW script
7. `matlab/+gik9dof/runStagedTrajectory.m` - Major updates
8. `matlab/+gik9dof/trackReferenceTrajectory.m` - Updates
9. `matlab/regenerate_iter_study_animations.m` - Updates
10. `matlab/renderWholeBodyAnimation.m` - NEW script
11. `run_environment_compare.m` - NEW (moved to top-level)
12. `run_staged_reference.m` - NEW (top-level)
13. `run_environment_compare_latest.m` - DELETED

### Files Modified ONLY in codegencc45:
- 551 files (codegen, ROS2, deployment, docs)
- Focus: 20-constraint GIK, ROS2 integration, ARM64 deployment

## Recommendation

**✅ MERGE origin/main INTO codegencc45**

**Reasoning**:
1. Your 20-constraint work is completely separate (codegen/ROS2 domain)
2. origin/main has useful simulation updates you may want
3. Minimal risk - different file sets
4. Keeps your branch up-to-date with main

**Steps**:
```powershell
# 1. Make sure your current work is committed (already done ✅)
git status

# 2. Merge origin/main
git merge origin/main

# 3. If conflicts, resolve them (likely just PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
# Edit conflicted files, then:
git add <resolved-files>
git commit

# 4. Verify everything works
# Test your ROS2 build, MATLAB scripts, etc.
```

**Expected Conflicts**:
- Possibly `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` (both branches updated it)
- Resolution: Keep both updates (yours about GIK, theirs about simulation)

**After Merge**:
- Your 71 commits preserved ✅
- Their 2 commits added ✅
- Ready to continue with Orin deployment ✅

## Decision Matrix

| Aspect | Merge origin/main | Cherry-pick | Keep Separate |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Complexity | Low | Medium | Low |
| Risk | Minimal | Minimal | None |
| Benefit | Full sync | Selective | Clean branches |
| Future merges | Easier | Harder | Deferred |
| **Recommendation** | ✅ **YES** | Maybe | Later |
