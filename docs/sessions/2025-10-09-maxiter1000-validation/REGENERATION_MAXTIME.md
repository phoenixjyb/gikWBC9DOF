# ðŸ”„ Regenerating Code with Relaxed Time Constraint

## Why Regenerate?

**Issue Found:** The previous validation showed only 30% pass rate (6/20) because:
- MaxTime = 0.05s (50ms) was **too restrictive**
- Solver hit time limit before MaxIterations=1000 could help
- Many tests returned status "b" (best iteration) instead of converging

## Changes Made:

**File:** `matlab/+gik9dof/+codegen_inuse/solveGIKStepWrapper.m`

```matlab
% OLD (Real-time constraint):
solver.SolverParameters.MaxTime = 0.05;        % 50ms - too tight!
solver.SolverParameters.MaxIterations = 1000;

% NEW (Validation mode):
solver.SolverParameters.MaxTime = 10.0;         % 10 seconds - generous for validation
solver.SolverParameters.MaxIterations = 1000;   % Can now actually use all iterations
```

## Expected Improvement:

### Previous Results (MaxTime=0.05s):
- Pass rate: 30% (6/20)
- Most tests hit time limit at ~50ms
- Iterations: 62-404 (couldn't use full 1000)
- Status: "b" (best iteration, not converged)

### Expected Results (MaxTime=10s):
- Pass rate: **60-80%** (12-16/20)
- Tests can run to convergence
- Iterations: Can use full 1000 if needed
- Status: "s" (success) for more cases

## Regeneration Command:

Run in WSL terminal:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF
/home/yanbo/MATLAB/R2024a/bin/matlab -batch "cd(pwd); run_wsl_codegen_matlab"
```

This will take **5-10 minutes**.

##After Regeneration:

1. **Rebuild validator:**
   ```bash
   cd validation
   bash build_with_library_wsl.sh
   ```

2. **Run validation again:**
   ```bash
   ./validate_gik_standalone gik_test_cases_20.json results_maxtime10s.json
   ```

3. **Compare results:**
   - Old: 30% pass (MaxTime=50ms)
   - New: Expected 60-80% pass (MaxTime=10s)

**Note:** For deployment to Jetson, you'll want to use a balanced MaxTime (e.g., 0.1-0.5s) between real-time performance and convergence quality.
