# 📊 Current Status - MaxIterations=1000 Validation

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Branch:** `wsl-linux-codegen-maxiter1000`

---

## ✅ Completed:

### 1. MaxIterations Updated
- ✅ Changed from 50 → 1000 in `solveGIKStepWrapper.m`
- ✅ ARM64 code generated (ready for Jetson)
- ✅ x86-64 code generated (for WSL validation)

### 2. WSL Linux Code Generation
- ✅ Used Linux MATLAB in WSL
- ✅ Generated Linux ELF binaries
- ✅ Built C++ validator successfully
- ✅ Pre-compiled library: `solveGIKStepWrapper.a` (1.2MB)

### 3. Initial Validation Testing
- ✅ Ran validation tests
- ⚠️ **Found issue:** MaxTime=50ms too restrictive
- Result: **30% pass rate (6/20)** - limited by time, not iterations

---

## 🔧 Current Action: Relaxing Time Constraint

### Issue Identified:
```
MaxTime = 0.05s (50ms)  ← TOO TIGHT!
MaxIterations = 1000     ← Can't be fully utilized

Result: Solver hits 50ms limit before using all 1000 iterations
```

### Solution Applied:
```matlab
% Updated in solveGIKStepWrapper.m:
MaxTime = 10.0  % 10 seconds (generous for validation)
MaxIterations = 1000
```

### Results from First Test (MaxTime=50ms):
```
Test 1:  105 iters, 53.7ms, status='b' (best, not converged) - FAIL
Test 2:  101 iters, 50.5ms, status='b' - FAIL
Test 3:  180 iters, 50.3ms, status='b' - FAIL  
Test 4:  297 iters, 40.3ms, status='s' (success) - FAIL (still too large error)
Test 8:  111 iters, 50.5ms, status='b' - PASS (lucky!)
...
Pass rate: 6/20 = 30%
```

**Observation:** Most tests hit the 50ms time limit!

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### 1. Regenerate Code (5-10 minutes)
**In WSL terminal:**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF
/home/yanbo/MATLAB/R2024a/bin/matlab -batch "cd(pwd); run_wsl_codegen_matlab"
```

OR use the all-in-one script:
```bash
chmod +x regenerate_and_validate.sh
./regenerate_and_validate.sh
```

### 2. Rebuild Validator
```bash
cd validation
bash build_with_library_wsl.sh
```

### 3. Run Validation Again
```bash
./validate_gik_standalone gik_test_cases_20.json results_maxtime10s.json
```

### 4. Expected Results
- **Pass rate:** 60-80% (12-16/20)
- **Iterations:** More tests will converge within 1000 iterations
- **Time:** Tests can take as long as needed (up to 10s)
- **Status:** More "s" (success), fewer "b" (best iteration)

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Target Improvement:
| Metric | Old (MaxIter=50) | Current (MaxTime=50ms) | Target (MaxTime=10s) |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| MaxIterations | 50 | 1000 | 1000 |
| MaxTime | 50ms | 50ms | 10s |
| Pass Rate | ~40% | 30% ⚠️ | **60-80%** 🎯 |
| Convergence | Limited | Time-limited | Iteration-limited ✅ |

---

## 💡 Key Insight

**The Problem:**
- We increased MaxIterations to 1000 ✅
- But MaxTime=50ms was too restrictive ❌
- Solver couldn't use the extra iterations!

**The Fix:**
- Relax MaxTime to 10s for validation
- Let the solver use all 1000 iterations
- See the TRUE benefit of the increase!

**For Deployment:**
- Use balanced settings (e.g., MaxTime=0.2s, MaxIter=1000)
- Trade-off between real-time and accuracy
- Tune based on Jetson performance

## 🚀 Ready to Continue

All files are updated and ready. Just run the regeneration script in WSL!

**Quick command:**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF
chmod +x regenerate_and_validate.sh
./regenerate_and_validate.sh
```

This will:
1. Regenerate code with MaxTime=10s
2. Rebuild the validator  
3. Run tests automatically
4. Show the improved results!

Expected completion: **10-15 minutes total**
