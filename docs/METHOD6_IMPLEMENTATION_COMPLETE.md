## Implementation Summary

Method 6 (Alternating Control) has been successfully implemented as a new Stage C execution mode. This method provides **real-time closed-loop control** by alternating between base and arm optimization every timestep.

### Core Innovation

Instead of solving one HARD 9-DOF optimization problem:
```
❌ Method 5 (Whole-body MPC): 
   170 variables × 10 horizon = 1700 constraints
   6,600 FK calls per solve
   4 seconds per step (40x too slow!)
```

Method 6 solves two EASY problems sequentially:
```
✅ Method 6 (Alternating Control):
   t=0:    Base optimizer [v, ω] with arm frozen (2 vars)
           → Expected: 5-20ms
   
   t=50ms: Arm optimizer [q̇₁...q̇₆] with base frozen (6 vars)  
           → Expected: 10-30ms
   
   Total: ~30ms per cycle → 30 Hz control rate!
   → 130x faster than Method 5!
```

**Function:** Main alternating control loop for Stage C tracking

**Algorithm:**
```
while not at goal:
    if timestep is EVEN:
        [v, ω] = solveBaseOptimization(...)  # Arm frozen
        Apply base motion: x += dt*v*cos(θ), etc.
        Arm holds position
    else:
        [q̇] = solveArmOptimization(...)      # Base frozen
        Base holds position
        Apply arm motion: q_arm += dt*q̇
    end
    
    Check if reached waypoint → advance
end
```

## Integration with Existing Architecture

### Seamless Integration ✅

Method 6 fits perfectly into the existing modular Stage C architecture:

```matlab
% In runStagedTrajectory.m, line 190-199
switch options.ExecutionMode
    case "ppForIk"     % Method 1 - Three-pass feed-forward
    case "pureIk"      % Method 0 - Unconstrained baseline
    case "ppFirst"     % Method 4 - PP-first with fallback
    case "alternating" % Method 6 - NEW! Alternating control ✨
    case "pureMPC"     % Method 5 - Whole-body MPC (slow)
end
```

result = gik9dof.runStagedReference('ExecutionMode', 'alternating');
```

### With Custom Configuration

```matlab
% Load aggressive profile for faster motion
cfg = gik9dof.loadPipelineProfile('aggressive');

% Run Method 6
result = gik9dof.runStagedReference(...
    'ExecutionMode', 'alternating', ...
    'PipelineConfig', cfg, ...
    'RateHz', 30);  % 30 Hz control rate

```

### Accessing Method 6 Specific Data

```matlab
% Get Stage C log
logC = result.stageLogs.stageC;

% Check base vs arm steps
base_steps = sum(strcmp(logC.mode, 'base'));
arm_steps = sum(strcmp(logC.mode, 'arm'));

% Analyze solve times
base_times = logC.solveTime(strcmp(logC.mode, 'base'));
arm_times = logC.solveTime(strcmp(logC.mode, 'arm'));

fprintf('Base optimization: %.1f ms avg\n', mean(base_times)*1000);
fprintf('Arm optimization: %.1f ms avg\n', mean(arm_times)*1000);
```

## Parameter Tuning

### Cost Weights (Adjust if needed)

#### Base Optimizer Weights
Located in: `runStageCAlternating.m`, function `getDefaultWeights('base')`

```matlab
weights.ee_pos = 100.0;      % ↑ Increase for tighter EE tracking
weights.ee_orient = 50.0;    % ↑ Increase for better orientation
weights.v = 1.0;             % ↑ Increase to slow down base
weights.omega = 10.0;        % ↑ Increase to reduce turning
weights.smooth_v = 5.0;      # ↑ Increase for smoother motion
weights.smooth_omega = 5.0;  # ↑ Increase for smoother turning
```

#### Arm Optimizer Weights
Located in: `runStageCAlternating.m`, function `getDefaultWeights('arm')`

```matlab
weights.ee_pos = 100.0;      % ↑ Increase for tighter EE tracking
weights.ee_orient = 50.0;    % ↑ Increase for better orientation
weights.q_dot = 0.01;        % ↑ Increase to slow arm motion
weights.smooth = 5.0;        # ↑ Increase for smoother motion
weights.posture = 0.1;       # ↑ Increase to favor nominal pose
```

### Control Rate

```matlab
% Start conservative (20 Hz = 50ms timesteps)
result = gik9dof.runStagedReference(...
    'ExecutionMode', 'alternating', ...
    'RateHz', 20);

% If solve times are good, increase to 30 Hz or 40 Hz
result = gik9dof.runStagedReference(...
    'ExecutionMode', 'alternating', ...
    'RateHz', 30);
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No MPC-style horizon:** Each step is myopic (no lookahead)
2. **Strict alternation:** Could benefit from overlapping predictions
3. **No analytical Jacobians yet:** Using numerical derivatives in fmincon
4. **Fixed cost weights:** No adaptive tuning based on error

### Future Enhancements (Post-POC)

1. **Predictive arm model in base optimizer:**
   ```matlab
   % Base optimizer predicts: "Where can arm reach from this base pose?"
   reach_penalty = weights.reach * max(0, ee_distance - arm_reach)^2;
   ```

2. **Damping factor to prevent oscillation:**
   ```matlab
   % Don't apply full optimal control
   u_applied = alpha * u_opt + (1-alpha) * u_prev;  % alpha = 0.8
   ```

3. **Adaptive weights based on error:**
   ```matlab
   if ee_error > 0.05  % 50mm
       weights.ee_pos = weights.ee_pos * 2;  % Prioritize tracking
   end
   ```

4. **Analytical Jacobians for 2x speedup:**
   - Use `geometricJacobian()` for gradient computation
   - Pass to fmincon via `SpecifyObjectiveGradient` option
