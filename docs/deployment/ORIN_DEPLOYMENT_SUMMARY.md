# AGX Orin Deployment Summary

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Branch**: `codegencc45`  
**Target**: NVIDIA AGX Orin (ARM64/aarch64)  
**Status**: ✅ **Successfully Built and Deployed**

---

## Executive Summary

The MATLAB-generated C++ IK solver has been successfully ported from x86_64 (Windows) to ARM64 (AGX Orin). The deployment required several architecture compatibility fixes but now builds cleanly and runs on the target hardware.

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Build Success
- **Package**: `gik9dof_solver` 
- **Build time**: ~41 seconds on AGX Orin
- **Compiler**: GCC 11.4.0 (ARM64)
- **ROS2**: Humble Hawksbill
- **Result**: Clean build with only harmless warnings (unused parameters in stubs)

### ✅ Files Created/Modified

#### New Files (ARM64 Compatibility)
1. **`ros2/gik9dof_solver/include/emmintrin.h`** (1,666 bytes)
   - SSE2 intrinsics compatibility stub for ARM64
   - Implements ~20 intrinsic functions (_mm_loadu_pd, _mm_storeu_pd, _mm_add_pd, etc.)
   - Provides both double-precision (pd) and integer (epi32) operations

2. **`ros2/gik9dof_solver/src/coder_posix_time_stubs.cpp`** (1,561 bytes)
   - POSIX time function implementations for MATLAB Coder
   - Uses Linux `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...)` for high-precision timing
   - Implements `coderTimeClockGettimeMonotonic`, `coderInitTimeFunctions`, `coderTimeSleep`

3. **`test_solver_arm64.sh`** (2,823 bytes)
   - Functional test script to verify solver operation
   - Checks node status, topics, and IK computation

4. **`docs/deployment/ARM64_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** (comprehensive)
   - Complete build instructions for ARM64
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Performance considerations
   - Known limitations

#### Modified Files
1. **`ros2/gik9dof_solver/CMakeLists.txt`**
   - Added ARM64 architecture detection
   - Compiler flags to disable x86 SSE/AVX (`__SSE2__=0`, `__AVX__=0`)
   - ARM NEON optimization flags (`-march=armv8-a`, `-mtune=cortex-a78`)
   - Added new source files to build

2. **`README.md`**
   - Added platform support table (Windows/WSL/ARM64)
   - Updated deployment section with ARM64 guide link
   - Added ARM64-specific quick start instructions

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. x86 SSE Intrinsics Incompatibility ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Problem**: MATLAB generated code with x86-specific SSE2 intrinsics that don't exist on ARM64.

**Error examples**:
```
error: '_mm_loadu_pd' was not declared in this scope
error: '_mm_storeu_pd' was not declared in this scope
error: '_mm_sqrt_pd' was not declared in this scope
error: '_mm_set1_epi32' was not declared in this scope
error: '_mm_add_epi32' was not declared in this scope
```

**Affected files** (6 MATLAB-generated source files):
- ErrorDampedLevenbergMarquardt.cpp
- PoseTarget.cpp
- RigidBodyTree.cpp
- GIKProblem.cpp
- generalizedInverseKinematics.cpp
- xgeqp3.cpp

**Solution implemented**:
- Created compatibility stub header with GCC vector extensions
- Used `__attribute__((__vector_size__(16)))` for SIMD types
- Implemented intrinsics using pointer arithmetic and scalar operations
- Added CMake flags to disable SSE code paths (`__SSE2__=0`)

**Risk assessment**:
- **Low-Medium**: MATLAB should use scalar fallback code when SSE is disabled
- Performance may be slightly degraded vs native x86
- ARM NEON optimizations (`-march=armv8-a`) should compensate

### 2. Missing POSIX Time Functions

**Problem**: Linker errors for MATLAB Coder timing functions.

**Errors**:
```
undefined reference to `coderTimeClockGettimeMonotonic'
undefined reference to `coderInitTimeFunctions'
```

**Solution implemented**:
- Created proper POSIX implementation using `clock_gettime()`
- Uses `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` for high-resolution, monotonic timing
- No compatibility concerns - native Linux API

---

## What Works

✅ **Confirmed working**:
- ROS2 package builds successfully on ARM64
- Solver node starts without crashes
- ROS2 topics are created correctly:
  - `/gik9dof/solver_diagnostics`
  - `/gik9dof/target_trajectory`
  - `/hdas/feedback_arm_left`
  - `/motion_target/target_joint_state_arm_left`
  - `/odom_wheel`

---

## What's Unknown / Needs Testing

⚠️ **Needs verification**:

1. **IK Solution Correctness**
   - Solver compiles and runs, but actual IK computation not yet validated
   - SSE intrinsics stubs may affect numerical accuracy
   - **Action needed**: Run functional test with known input/output

2. **Performance on ARM64**
   - No benchmarks yet for solve time
   - Unknown if scalar fallback significantly impacts performance
   - **Action needed**: Compare solve times vs x86 baseline

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Singular configurations
   - Joint limit handling
   - Convergence in difficult poses

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. No Collision Avoidance
- Solver generated with `generate_code_noCollision.m`
- Pure IK only - no self-collision or obstacle avoidance
- **Impact**: Acceptable for trajectory tracking without obstacles

### 2. SSE Compatibility Layer
- Using stubs instead of native SSE intrinsics
- May have performance penalty vs native x86
- **Mitigation**: ARM NEON optimizations enabled

### 3. No Performance Benchmarking
- Actual solve times not measured
- Real-time capability (< 50ms) not verified on ARM64

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. **✅ Document deployment** - DONE
2. **⏳ Functional testing** - Run test_solver_arm64.sh
3. **⏳ Validate IK solutions** - Send known trajectory, verify output

### Short-term (Performance)
4. **⏳ Benchmark solve times** - Compare ARM64 vs x86
5. **⏳ Profile performance** - Identify bottlenecks
6. **⏳ Test real-time capability** - Verify < 50ms solve time

### Long-term (Optimization)
7. **Optional: MATLAB regeneration** - Generate code with ARM64 target (if MATLAB supports)
8. **Optional: NEON intrinsics** - Replace SSE stubs with native ARM NEON
9. **Optional: Add collision** - If collision avoidance is needed

## Conclusion

The ARM64 deployment is a **qualified success**:

✅ **Positives**:
- Clean build on target hardware
- No runtime crashes
- ROS2 integration working
- Proper documentation created

⚠️ **Caveats**:
- IK solution correctness not yet validated
- Performance not benchmarked
- SSE compatibility layer untested under load

**Recommendation**: Proceed with functional testing to verify IK computation before deploying to production robot.
