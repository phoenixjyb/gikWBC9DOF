# WSL Ubuntu 22.04 Validation Guide

**Purpose**: Use WSL as an intermediate validation environment to catch build issues, dependency problems, and ROS2 integration bugs **before** deploying to AGX Orin.

---

## Why This Matters

**Risk Reduction Strategy**:
- ‚úÖ **Same OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 on both WSL and AGX Orin ‚Üí identical package versions
- ‚úÖ **Same ROS2**: Humble on both ‚Üí identical message formats, colcon behavior
- ‚úÖ **Build Validation**: Catch CMake errors, missing dependencies, linking issues on WSL
- ‚úÖ **ROS2 Testing**: Validate node startup, topic communication, message serialization
- ‚úÖ **Fast Iteration**: No need to SCP to AGX Orin for every test

**What WSL Won't Catch**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ARM64-specific runtime issues (WSL is x86_64, Orin is ARM64)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance differences (WSL has different CPU, no NEON SIMD)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardware-specific issues (CAN bus, GPIO, etc.)

**Bottom Line**: WSL validates 80% of integration before touching the robot. Worth it!

---

## Prerequisites

Verify WSL environment (run in WSL terminal):

```bash
# Check OS version
lsb_release -a
# Expected: Ubuntu 22.04.x LTS

# Check ROS2 version
echo $ROS_DISTRO
# Expected: humble

# Check colcon
which colcon
# Expected: /usr/bin/colcon (or similar)

# Check required packages
dpkg -l | grep -E "eigen3|omp|yaml-cpp"
# Expected: libeigen3-dev, libomp-dev, libyaml-cpp-dev
```

**If packages missing**, install:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  ros-humble-rclcpp \
  ros-humble-sensor-msgs \
  ros-humble-nav-msgs \
  ros-humble-geometry-msgs \
  libeigen3-dev \
  libomp-dev \
  libyaml-cpp-dev \
  build-essential
```

## Workflow: Windows ‚Üí WSL ‚Üí AGX Orin

### Step 1: Generate Code on Windows (MATLAB)

```matlab
% In MATLAB R2024b on Windows:
cd C:\Users\yanbo\wSpace\codegenGIKsample\Trial\gikWBC9DOF
RUN_VALIDATION  % Must pass first!
RUN_CODEGEN     % Generates gik9dof_deployment_<timestamp>.zip
```

**Output**: `gik9dof_deployment_20251006_143022.zip` (timestamp varies)

### Step 2: Copy to WSL

**From Windows PowerShell** (easier than WSL‚ÜíWindows file access):

```powershell
# Find the latest deployment ZIP
$latestZip = Get-ChildItem -Path . -Filter "gik9dof_deployment_*.zip" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1

# Copy to WSL home directory
wsl cp "/mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/$($latestZip.Name)" ~/gik9dof_deployment.zip
```

**Or manually** (if above fails):
```powershell
# From Windows, copy to your WSL home:
wsl mkdir -p ~/gik9dof_test
Copy-Item gik9dof_deployment_*.zip \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\home\<your-username>\gik9dof_test\
```

### Step 3: Extract and Build on WSL

**In WSL terminal**:

```bash
# Navigate to test directory
cd ~/gik9dof_test

# Extract deployment package
unzip gik9dof_deployment.zip
# Creates: gik9dof_deployment/gik9dof_msgs/, gik9dof_deployment/gik9dof_solver/

# Source ROS2 environment
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Build messages first (dependency for solver)
cd ~/gik9dof_test/gik9dof_deployment
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_msgs
source install/setup.bash

# Build solver node
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_solver

# Check for build errors
echo $?  # Should be 0
```

**Expected Build Output**:
```
Starting >>> gik9dof_msgs
Finished <<< gik9dof_msgs [10.2s]
Starting >>> gik9dof_solver
Finished <<< gik9dof_solver [45.3s]

Summary: 2 packages finished [55.6s]
```

### Step 4: Inspect Generated Code Integration

**Check if MATLAB-generated C++ is properly linked**:

```bash
# Look for generated code in solver package
ls -lh ~/gik9dof_test/gik9dof_deployment/gik9dof_solver/src/generated/

# Expected files (if code generation worked):
# - buildRobotForCodegen.cpp/h
# - solveGIKStepWrapper.cpp/h
# - generalizedInverseKinematics.cpp/h
# - (50+ other generated files)

# Check if solver node compiled
ls -lh ~/gik9dof_test/gik9dof_deployment/install/gik9dof_solver/lib/gik9dof_solver/
# Expected: gik9dof_solver_node (executable)
```

**üö® CRITICAL CHECK**: If `src/generated/` is empty, code generation failed! Go back to Windows and check `codegen/html/report.mldatx` for errors.

### Step 5: Test ROS2 Node Startup

**Source workspace and launch solver**:

```bash
cd ~/gik9dof_test/gik9dof_deployment
source install/setup.bash

# Launch solver node (should start without errors)
ros2 launch gik9dof_solver test_solver.launch.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[gik9dof_solver_node]: Waiting for initial robot state...
[gik9dof_solver_node]: Waiting for initial odometry...
[gik9dof_solver_node]: Waiting for trajectory...
[gik9dof_solver_node]: Control loop running at 10 Hz
```

**If node crashes**, check:
- Missing shared libraries: `ldd install/gik9dof_solver/lib/gik9dof_solver/gik9dof_solver_node`
- Missing dependencies: Install libeigen3-dev, libomp-dev
- Segmentation fault: Check generated code arrays match robot DOF (should be 9)

### Step 6: Test with Mock Inputs

**Open new WSL terminal** (keep solver running in first terminal):

```bash
cd ~/gik9dof_test/gik9dof_deployment
source install/setup.bash

# Run mock input publisher
ros2 run gik9dof_solver test_mock_inputs.py
```

**Expected Output (from solver terminal)**:
```
[gik9dof_solver_node]: Received initial robot state (6 joints)
[gik9dof_solver_node]: Received initial odometry
[gik9dof_solver_node]: Received trajectory (5 waypoints)
[gik9dof_solver_node]: Solver diagnostics: status=1, iterations=12, solve_time=3.4ms
```

**Monitor diagnostics**:

```bash
# In third terminal:
source install/setup.bash
ros2 topic echo /gik9dof/solver_diagnostics
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ `status: 1` (success, not 0=failure or 2=warning)
- ‚úÖ `iterations < 100` (solver converges quickly)
- ‚úÖ `solve_time_ms < 50.0` (meets 10 Hz requirement: 100ms budget, 50ms for solver)
- ‚úÖ `distance_to_goal < 0.05` (within 5cm of target)

**Failure Modes to Check**:
- ‚ùå `status: 0` ‚Üí Solver diverged, check constraints or initial guess
- ‚ùå `solve_time_ms > 100` ‚Üí Performance issue, check x86_64 vs ARM64 difference
- ‚ùå No diagnostics published ‚Üí Node crashed, check `ros2 node list`

### Step 7: Verify Joint Commands Published

```bash
# Check if solver is publishing commands
ros2 topic hz /motion_target/target_joint_state_arm_left
# Expected: average rate: 10.000 Hz

ros2 topic echo /motion_target/target_joint_state_arm_left --once
# Expected: 6 joint positions (arm joints only, not base)
```

## Common WSL Build Issues

### Issue 1: `colcon: command not found`

**Fix**:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```

### Issue 2: `fatal error: Eigen/Dense: No such file or directory`

**Fix**:
```bash
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
# Verify: ls /usr/include/eigen3/Eigen/Dense
```

### Issue 3: `ld: cannot find -lomp`

**Fix**:
```bash
sudo apt install libomp-dev
```

### Issue 4: Custom messages not found (`gik9dof_msgs/msg/*.hpp`)

**Fix**: Build messages package first, then source:
```bash
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_msgs
source install/setup.bash  # Critical!
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_solver
```

### Issue 5: Generated code missing (`src/generated/` is empty)

**Root Cause**: MATLAB code generation failed on Windows.

**Fix**:
1. Go back to Windows MATLAB
2. Check `codegen/html/report.mldatx` for errors
3. Common issues:
   - Unsupported Robotics Toolbox functions ‚Üí Rewrite in pure math
   - Dynamic memory allocation ‚Üí Disable in codegen config
   - Variable-size arrays ‚Üí Set explicit bounds

### Issue 6: Node starts but no topics published

**Debug**:
```bash
# Check if node is running
ros2 node list
# Expected: /gik9dof_solver_node

# Check declared topics
ros2 node info /gik9dof_solver_node
# Expected publishers: /motion_target/target_joint_state_arm_left, /gik9dof/solver_diagnostics

# Check for errors in node output
# Look for: "Waiting for initial robot state..." ‚Üí Need to publish joint states
```

## Validation Checklist (WSL Sign-Off)

Before deploying to AGX Orin, confirm:

- [ ] **Build Clean**: `colcon build` exits with code 0, no warnings
- [ ] **Packages Built**: `install/gik9dof_msgs/` and `install/gik9dof_solver/` exist
- [ ] **Generated Code Exists**: `gik9dof_solver/src/generated/*.cpp` not empty
- [ ] **Node Starts**: `ros2 launch gik9dof_solver test_solver.launch.py` no crash
- [ ] **Topics Published**: `ros2 topic list` shows `/gik9dof/solver_diagnostics`
- [ ] **Mock Inputs Work**: test_mock_inputs.py publishes, solver receives data
- [ ] **Solver Converges**: `status=1`, `solve_time_ms < 50`, `iterations < 100`
- [ ] **Joint Commands**: `/motion_target/target_joint_state_arm_left` publishes at 10 Hz

**If all checkboxes passed**: ‚úÖ Ready for AGX Orin deployment!

**If any failed**: ‚ùå Fix on WSL first. Do NOT deploy broken code to robot.

## Next Steps After WSL Validation

Once WSL tests pass:

1. **Package for AGX Orin**: Already done (gik9dof_deployment.zip)
2. **Deploy**: Run `.\deploy_to_orin.ps1 <orin-ip>` from Windows PowerShell
3. **Build on Orin**: Same `colcon build` commands (should work identically)
4. **Test on Orin**: Same test_solver.launch.py (verify ARM64 performance)
5. **Integrate**: Replace mock inputs with real robot topics

## Performance Expectations: WSL vs AGX Orin

| Metric | WSL (x86_64) | AGX Orin (ARM64) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Solve Time | 5-20 ms | 3-15 ms | Orin has 12-core ARM Cortex-A78AE, should be faster |
| Build Time | 1-2 min | 2-5 min | Orin has slower clock speed but more cores |
| Memory Usage | ~50 MB | ~50 MB | Should be identical (same code) |
| Max Frequency | 20-30 Hz | 50+ Hz | Orin optimized for real-time (NEON SIMD, OpenMP) |

**Note**: WSL solve time may be **slower** than Orin because:
- No ARM NEON SIMD vectorization (x86_64 uses SSE/AVX instead)
- Virtual machine overhead
- Different CPU architecture

**Don't panic if WSL is slower!** Focus on:
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds
- ‚úÖ Solver converges (`status=1`)
- ‚úÖ No crashes or segfaults

Performance will improve on Orin with ARM64 native code.

## Quick Reference: WSL Commands

```bash
# Build everything
cd ~/gik9dof_test/gik9dof_deployment
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

# Launch solver
ros2 launch gik9dof_solver test_solver.launch.py

# (New terminal) Run mock inputs
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run gik9dof_solver test_mock_inputs.py

# (New terminal) Monitor diagnostics
source install/setup.bash
ros2 topic echo /gik9dof/solver_diagnostics

# Check topic rates
ros2 topic hz /motion_target/target_joint_state_arm_left
```

---

## Troubleshooting: WSL-Specific Issues

### WSL Can't Access Windows Files

If `wsl cp` fails:

**Option 1**: Use Windows file system from WSL
```bash
# Windows C:\ is mounted at /mnt/c/
cd /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF
cp gik9dof_deployment_*.zip ~/gik9dof_test/
```

**Option 2**: Use Windows Explorer
1. Open Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\home\<username>\gik9dof_test`
3. Drag and drop the ZIP file

### ROS2 Not Sourced

Every new terminal needs:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/gik9dof_test/gik9dof_deployment/install/setup.bash
```

**Or** add to `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Permissions Error on Executables

```bash
# Make node executable
chmod +x ~/gik9dof_test/gik9dof_deployment/install/gik9dof_solver/lib/gik9dof_solver/gik9dof_solver_node
```

## Summary: WSL as Safety Net

**What WSL Validates**:
- ‚úÖ ROS2 package structure (CMakeLists.txt, package.xml)
- ‚úÖ Message definitions (EndEffectorTrajectory, SolverDiagnostics)
- ‚úÖ Node compilation (C++17, ROS2 Humble API)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies (Eigen, OpenMP, YAML-CPP)
- ‚úÖ Topic communication (pub/sub, serialization)
- ‚úÖ Node lifecycle (startup, shutdown, error handling)

**What WSL Doesn't Validate**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ARM64 NEON performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real robot sensor data (CAN bus, encoders)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time scheduling (PREEMPT_RT kernel on Orin)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardware-specific issues

**Bottom Line**: WSL catches 80% of integration bugs. Use it!

## Success Path

1. ‚úÖ MATLAB validation passes on Windows
2. ‚úÖ MATLAB code generation succeeds on Windows
3. ‚úÖ WSL build succeeds (this guide)
4. ‚úÖ WSL solver node starts without crash
5. ‚úÖ WSL mock tests show `status=1`, solve_time < 50ms
6. ‚úÖ Deploy to AGX Orin with confidence
7. ‚úÖ Orin build succeeds (should be identical to WSL)
8. ‚úÖ Orin tests pass (better performance than WSL)
9. ‚úÖ Integrate with real robot
10. ‚úÖ Ship it! üöÄ

You're now using a **3-tier validation strategy**:
- **Tier 1 (Windows MATLAB)**: Algorithm correctness, code generation feasibility
- **Tier 2 (WSL Ubuntu)**: ROS2 integration, build system, dependencies
- **Tier 3 (AGX Orin)**: ARM64 performance, real robot integration

This is **best practice** for robotics software deployment. Well done!
