# How to Use CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md

## üìã Quick Copy/Paste for New Conversation

If you hit the context window limit and need to start a new conversation:

### Step 1: Copy the File
Open `CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md` and copy the **entire content** (504 lines)

### Step 2: Start New Conversation
Paste the entire document into the new conversation, then add:

```
I'm continuing work on the CODEGENCC45 project. I've read the context handoff document.

Current status: [Choose one]
- [ ] Just completed MATLAB validation (RUN_VALIDATION passed)
- [ ] Just completed code generation (have gik9dof_deployment_<timestamp>.zip)
- [ ] Just completed WSL build and tests
- [ ] Just deployed to AGX Orin
- [ ] Currently integrating with real robot

My next question/task: [describe what you need help with]
```

### Step 3: Continue Work
The new agent will have complete context and can continue seamlessly.

### Key Numbers
- **Total lines**: 504
- **Sections**: 12
- **Code blocks**: 15+ (copy/paste ready)
- **File references**: Links to all 15 documentation files
- **Commands**: Windows, WSL, AGX Orin workflows

## üéØ What It Preserves

### ‚úÖ Technical Context
- Robot configuration (9 DOF, URDF path)
- ROS2 topics (exact names, message types)
- Code generation settings (ARM64, C++17, NEON, etc.)
- Solver parameters (max iterations, tolerances)

### ‚úÖ Workflow State
- Where you are in the 4-step process
- What commands have been run
- What files have been created
- What errors were fixed

### ‚úÖ Design Decisions
- Why holistic control (not separate base + arm)
- Why WSL intermediate validation
- Why pure pursuit is simulation-only
- Why 10 Hz initially (expandable to 50 Hz)

### ‚úÖ Documentation Map
- Which file to read for what purpose
- Quick access by task (execution, troubleshooting, architecture)
- Links to all 15 markdown files

### ‚úÖ Known Issues
- RUN_VALIDATION namespace error (FIXED)
- Build artifacts handling (intentionally not committed)
- Common pitfalls (sourcing workspace, building messages first)

## üöÄ Pro Tips

### When to Use This
- **Context window > 80%**: Proactively copy before hitting limit
- **New conversation needed**: Paste to continue work
- **Collaborating**: Share with team member to bring them up to speed
- **Coming back later**: Re-read to remember where you left off

### What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå Don't paste only part of the document (agent needs complete context)
- ‚ùå Don't forget to add your current status when pasting
- ‚ùå Don't skip the "my next question/task" part (helps agent focus)

### What to Add When Pasting
Always append:
1. Your current location in workflow (which step)
2. What you just completed (if anything)
3. What you're trying to do next
4. Any specific errors or blockers

## üìù Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Hit Context Limit During Code Generation

**Copy this + add**:
```
[Paste entire CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md]

Current status: 
- [x] MATLAB validation passed
- [x] Running RUN_CODEGEN now (in progress)

My next question: 
Code generation is taking longer than 15 minutes. Is this normal? 
Should I wait or check for errors?
```

### Scenario 2: WSL Build Failed

**Copy this + add**:
```
[Paste entire CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md]

Current status:
- [x] MATLAB validation passed
- [x] Code generation completed
- [x] Copied to WSL
- [ ] WSL build FAILED

Error message:
CMake Error: Could not find Eigen3

My next question:
How do I install Eigen3 on WSL? The guide mentions libeigen3-dev but the error persists.
```

### Scenario 3: Coming Back Tomorrow

**Copy this + add**:
```
[Paste entire CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md]

Current status:
- [x] Everything up to WSL validation completed yesterday
- [x] WSL tests all passed (status=1, solve_time=8ms)

My next task:
Deploy to AGX Orin now. What's the exact command and what should I check first?
```
