# Archived Session Documentation

This directory contains historical session notes and work-in-progress documentation from the development of the GIK 9-DOF controller.

## Organization

### `/sessions/` - Development Session Summaries

Chronological notes from development sessions, including:
- Problem analysis
- Solution attempts
- Implementation details
- Validation results

**Files**:
- ARM64-specific work (ARM64_SESSION_SUMMARY.md, ARM64_SOLVER_HANG_ISSUE.md)
- Cleanup and refactoring sessions (CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md)
- Feature development (GIK_ENHANCEMENTS_SESSION_SUMMARY.md)
- Integration work (HYBRID_ASTAR_SESSION_PROGRESS.md, HYBRID_ASTAR_SESSION_SUMMARY.md)
- Project phases (PHASE1_2_SESSION_SUMMARY.md, SESSION_SUMMARY_PHASE2A.md)
- Technical deep-dives (VALIDATION_SESSION_SUMMARY.md, USERNAME_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md)

### `/namespace-conflict/` - Namespace Fix History

Work-in-progress documentation for resolving the namespace conflict between GIK solver and Hybrid A* planner:

**Files**:
- `NAMESPACE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` - Detailed technical analysis (800+ lines)
- `NAMESPACE_RENAMING.md` - Attempted solution via renaming
- `NAMESPACES_EXPLAINED.md` - Understanding the conflict

**Final Solution**: See [NAMESPACE_CONFLICT_RESOLVED.md](../../NAMESPACE_CONFLICT_RESOLVED.md) in root

## Why Archive These?

These documents contain valuable historical context:
- **Problem-solving approaches** - Shows what didn't work and why
- **Design decisions** - Rationale behind architectural choices
- **Lessons learned** - Pitfalls and solutions for future reference
- **Evolution tracking** - How the system evolved over time

While not needed for day-to-day development, they're preserved for:
- Onboarding new developers
- Understanding system design rationale
- Debugging similar future issues
- Project documentation completeness
