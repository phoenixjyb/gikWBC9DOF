# Orin Build Fix - October 9, 2025

## Problem
1. CMake cache contains Windows paths from development machine
2. Duplicate package `gik9dof_solver_bak` detected

## âœ… Solution Applied

Cleaned up remotely via SSH:
```bash
ssh cr@192.168.100.150
cd /home/nvidia/temp_gikrepo/ros2
rm -rf build install log gik9dof_solver_bak
```

## Now Ready to Build

```bash
ssh cr@192.168.100.150
cd /home/nvidia/temp_gikrepo/ros2

# Build packages
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_msgs
source install/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_solver

# Test
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run gik9dof_solver gik9dof_solver_node \
    --ros-args --params-file src/gik9dof_solver/config/gik9dof_solver_params.yaml
```

## Prevention for Future Deployments
Updated `scripts/deployment/deploy_to_orin_complete.ps1` to exclude:
- `build/` `install/` `log/` directories  
- `*_bak` packages
- `*_backup_*` folders

The ARM64 C++ compilation will happen natively on Orin during `colcon build`! ðŸš€
