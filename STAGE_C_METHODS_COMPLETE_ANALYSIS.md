## Detailed Method Comparison

### Method 0: Pure IK (Baseline)
**Purpose:** Debugging and theoretical workspace analysis

**Architecture:**
```
For each waypoint:
  └─> GIK solve with all DOF free (no base constraints)
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Simplest, fastest
- ❌ Base motion violates differential drive
- ❌ Not suitable for real robot

---

### Method 1: PP-For-IK (Current Production)
**Purpose:** Production-proven three-pass approach

**Architecture:**
```
Pass 1: GIK with Free Base
  └─> Generate ideal reference trajectory
        ↓
Pass 2: Pure Pursuit Simulation  
  └─> Realistic base path (differential drive enforced)
        ↓
Pass 3: GIK with Fixed Base
  └─> Final trajectory with feasible base, compensated arm
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Base motion guaranteed feasible
- ✅ Well-tested, stable
- ✅ Moderate computation time
- ❌ **No feedback loop** - if Pass 2 deviates significantly, Pass 3 may fail
- ❌ **No recovery** - accepts >200mm errors if they occur

**From projectDiagnosis.md:**
> "⚠️ CRITICAL WEAKNESS: The current three-pass architecture has no feedback mechanism. If deviation too large → ARM CANNOT REACH TARGET → EE error >200mm (classified as "poor") → NO WAY TO RECOVER!"

**Failure Mode:**
```
Pass 1: Base wants Position A (ideal, 5.0m, 3.0m, 45°)
Pass 2: Base ends at Position B (realistic, 5.7m, 2.3m, 38°) - 1.4m deviation!
Pass 3: Arm tries to compensate → fails with 300mm EE error
Result: Accept failure, no recovery
```

---

### Method 4: PP-First (NEW - October 2025) ⭐
**Purpose:** Feedback-driven approach with fallback recovery

**Architecture:**
```
For each waypoint (per-waypoint feedback loop):
  1. PREDICT: Pure Pursuit → base motion (v, ω)
     └─> Guaranteed differential drive feasible
  
  2. CONSTRAIN: Update GIK bounds
     └─> θ ∈ [θ_PP ± 15°]
     └─> x ∈ [x_PP ± 0.15m], y ∈ [y_PP ± 0.15m]
  
  3. SOLVE: GIK with soft constraints
     └─> Find q that reaches EE target within corridor
  
  4. CHECK: Measure EE error
     └─> If error > 10mm → FALLBACK
  
  5. FALLBACK (if triggered):
     └─> Fix base at PP prediction
     └─> Solve arm-only IK for EE target
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Per-waypoint feedback** - catches errors immediately
- ✅ **Fallback mechanism** - graceful degradation
- ✅ **Guaranteed feasible base** - PP ensures differential drive
- ✅ **Soft constraints** - yaw corridor allows GIK flexibility
- ⚠️ Slightly slower than Method 1
- ⚠️ Fallback rate ~20% on test trajectories

**Test Results (Integration Test - 5 waypoints):**
```
✅ EE error: mean 12.18mm, max 60.90mm
✅ Fallback rate: 20% (1/5 waypoints)
✅ Yaw drift from PP: mean 1.1°, max 3.7°
✅ Total time: 2.58 seconds
```

**Key Innovation:** Method 4 addresses Method 1's weakness by adding **per-waypoint error checking and recovery**:
```
Method 1: Pass 1 → Pass 2 → Pass 3 → (if fails, accept)
Method 4: For each waypoint: Predict → Try → Check → (if fails, Fallback)
```

### MPC Approach (From g5wbcMpcDesign.md - Future Work)
**Purpose:** Real-time closed-loop control with nonholonomic dynamics

**Architecture:**
```
At each control cycle (20-50 Hz):
  Solve NMPC over horizon N=20 steps (1-2s lookahead):
    Decision variables: [v, ω, q̇_arm, ṡ] for k=0..N
    Minimize: ‖EE_error‖² + λ‖u‖² + smoothness
    Subject to:
      - Nonholonomic: ẋ = v·cos(θ), ẏ = v·sin(θ), θ̇ = ω
      - Wheel speeds: |v ± ω·0.285| ≤ v_wheel_max
      - Joint/velocity limits
      - Collision avoidance (base + arm)
      - Progress variable (time-scaling)
  Apply first control: (v₀, ω₀, q̇₀)
  Receding horizon: Shift and repeat
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Fundamentally nonholonomic** - v_y ≡ 0 in dynamics
- ✅ **Real-time closed-loop** - runs during execution (20-50 Hz)
- ✅ **Collision-aware** - optimization includes obstacles
- ✅ **Automatic coordination** - solver decides base vs arm
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - time-scaling slows down instead of failing
- ⚠️ **Complete paradigm change** - replaces GIK entirely
- ⚠️ **High implementation effort** - requires CasADi/IPOPT or custom SCP
- ⚠️ **Research-level complexity**

**Key Difference from Methods 1 & 4:**
> "In classical whole-body IK you might give the base virtual (x,y,θ) and the solver happily 'slides' y. Here, **y only changes via v·sin(θ)**."

Methods 1 & 4:
- GIK can request sideways motion (v_y ≠ 0)
- Must correct post-hoc (Method 1) or per-waypoint (Method 4)

MPC Approach:
- **Cannot request sideways motion** - physically impossible in formulation
- No correction needed - always feasible by construction

| Aspect | Method 1<br>(ppForIk) | Method 4<br>(ppFirst) | MPC<br>(Proposed) |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Paradigm** | Batch planning | Per-waypoint planning | Real-time control |
| **Solver** | GIK (2 passes) | GIK + PP (per waypoint) | NMPC (optimization) |
| **Feedback** | ❌ None | ✅ Per waypoint | ✅ Every cycle (20-50Hz) |
| **Recovery** | ❌ None | ✅ Fallback mechanism | ✅ Automatic via MPC |

| **Status** | Production | NEW (Oct 2025) | Future research |

## The Fundamental Problem: "Sideways Base"

### Root Cause (Methods 0, 1, 4)
All GIK-based methods treat base as 3 virtual joints:
```matlab
joint_x:     -inf to +inf (prismatic)
joint_y:     -inf to +inf (prismatic)  ← Can slide sideways!
joint_theta: -inf to +inf (revolute)
```

GIK can request any (x, y) position → "sideways slide" violates differential drive.

### How Each Method Handles It

**Method 0 (pureIk):**
- Does nothing ❌
- Base motion infeasible

**Method 1 (ppForIk):**
- Corrects post-hoc in Pass 2
- But if correction large (>1m), Pass 3 may fail
- No recovery mechanism

**Method 4 (ppFirst):**
- Pre-constrains GIK with corridor around PP prediction
- Checks error per waypoint
- Falls back to arm-only if needed
- **Better but still band-aid solution**

**MPC Approach:**
- **Eliminates the problem** at the root
- Base controlled by (v, ω), not (x, y, θ)
- Dynamics: x' = v·cos(θ), y' = v·sin(θ)
- **Physically impossible to violate differential drive**

## Evolution of Stage C Methods

### Timeline

```
Stage C Method Evolution
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2024-2025: Method 0 & 1 (Original Implementation)
├─ Method 0 (pureIk): Baseline for debugging
└─ Method 1 (ppForIk): Production system
   └─> Three-pass feed-forward
   └─> Works well for conservative trajectories
   └─> ~95% success rate
   └─> ❌ No recovery from failures

October 2025: Method 4 (NEW!)
├─ Motivation: Address Method 1's failure modes
├─ Architecture: Per-waypoint feedback + fallback
├─ Test results: 12mm mean error, 20% fallback rate
└─> ✅ Graceful degradation instead of hard failures

Future: MPC Approach (Proposed)
├─ Motivation: Fundamentally solve nonholonomic problem
├─ Architecture: Real-time receding horizon
├─ Expected: <10mm error, 20-50 Hz control
└─> Requires significant development effort
```

### Decision Points

**Why Method 4 was created:**
From projectDiagnosis.md findings:
- Method 1 can have >200mm EE errors with no recovery
- Need per-waypoint error checking
- Need fallback mechanism for difficult cases

**Why MPC is proposed but not implemented:**
- Method 4 addresses immediate needs
- MPC requires CasADi/IPOPT integration
- Research-level complexity
- Will reconsider if Method 4 shows systematic failures

## Usage Guide

### For Production Deployment

**Start with Method 1** (battle-tested):
```matlab
pipeline = gik9dof.runStagedTrajectory(robot, traj, ...
    'ExecutionMode', 'ppForIk', ...  % Method 1 (DEFAULT)
    'ChassisProfile', 'wide_track');
```

**Switch to Method 4** if seeing tracking failures:
```matlab
pipeline = gik9dof.runStagedTrajectory(robot, traj, ...
    'ExecutionMode', 'ppFirst', ...  % Method 4 (NEW)
    'ChassisProfile', 'wide_track');
```

### For Debugging

**Quick arm workspace check:**
```matlab
pipeline = gik9dof.runStagedTrajectory(robot, traj, ...
    'ExecutionMode', 'pureIk');  % Method 0
```

### For Research/Comparison

**Compare all methods:**
```matlab
methods = {'pureIk', 'ppForIk', 'ppFirst'};
results = cell(1, 3);

for i = 1:length(methods)
    results{i} = gik9dof.runStagedTrajectory(robot, traj, ...
        'ExecutionMode', methods{i}, ...
        'ConfigTools', configTools);
end

% Analyze and compare
compareMethodPerformance(results{1}, results{2}, results{3});
```
