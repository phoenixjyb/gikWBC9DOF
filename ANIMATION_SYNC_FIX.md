# Animation EE Marker Synchronization Fix

**Issue Reported:** Red dot (Stage C reference EE waypoint) is not synchronized with robot motion - it starts way behind the robot's action.

**Date Fixed:** October 11, 2025  
**File Modified:** `matlab/+gik9dof/animateStagedWithHelper.m`

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The synchronization issue was caused by **double-sampling** of the EE reference trajectory:

### Original Code (BUGGY):
```matlab
% Line 30-31: Sample arm and base trajectories
armTrajectory = armTrajectory(1:opts.SampleStep:end, :);
basePose = basePose(1:opts.SampleStep:end, :);

% Line 50-55: Load or compute EE path
if isempty(eePathStageCRef)
    eePathStageCRef = computeEEPath(robot, qTraj(:, 1:opts.SampleStep:end));
end

eePoses = eePathStageCRef(:, 1:opts.SampleStep:end)';  % ❌ BUG: Double sampling!
```

### The Problem:
1. **First sampling:** `armTrajectory` and `basePose` are sampled at `SampleStep` intervals (e.g., every 2nd frame)
2. **Second sampling:** `eePoses` from the full `eePathStageCRef` is sampled AGAIN
3. **Result:** If `SampleStep=2`:
   - Robot shows frames: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...]
   - EE marker shows frames: [1, 5, 9, 13, 17, ...] (every 2nd of already-sampled frames)
   - **Mismatch:** EE marker lags behind by increasingly larger amounts

### Example Timeline (SampleStep=2):
| Animation Frame | Robot (arm/base) | EE Marker (buggy) | Expected EE |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | qTraj frame 1 | eePathStageCRef frame 1 | eePathStageCRef frame 1 ✅ |
| 2 | qTraj frame 3 | eePathStageCRef frame 5 ❌ | eePathStageCRef frame 3 |
| 3 | qTraj frame 5 | eePathStageCRef frame 9 ❌ | eePathStageCRef frame 5 |
| 4 | qTraj frame 7 | eePathStageCRef frame 13 ❌ | eePathStageCRef frame 7 |

The EE marker quickly falls behind and never catches up!

## The Fix

### Fixed Code:
```matlab
if isempty(eePathStageCRef)
    % Compute EE path for the already-sampled trajectory
    eePathStageCRef = computeEEPath(robot, qTraj(:, 1:opts.SampleStep:end));
    eePoses = eePathStageCRef';  % ✅ Already sampled, no double-sampling
else
    % eePathStageCRef from logs has full trajectory, needs sampling
    eePoses = eePathStageCRef(:, 1:opts.SampleStep:end)';  % ✅ Sample once
end
```

### What Changed:
1. **If `eePathStageCRef` is computed:** It's computed from the already-sampled `qTraj`, so just transpose it
2. **If `eePathStageCRef` comes from logs:** It has the full trajectory, so sample it once to match the robot frames

### Result:
- **Robot frames:** [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...]
- **EE marker frames:** [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...] ✅ **SYNCHRONIZED!**

## Impact on Existing Animations

### Animations Generated BEFORE Fix (20251011 09:25-09:34):
All 5 parametric study animations have the synchronization bug:
- `Baseline_Tuned_SM0.10_LC1.0_EE0.0038_Cusps2_Jerk20.6.mp4` ❌
- `Aggressive_LowSafety_SM0.05_LC0.5_EE0.0038_Cusps2_Jerk20.6.mp4` ❌
- `Conservative_HighSafety_SM0.20_LC3.0_EE0.0038_Cusps2_Jerk20.6.mp4` ❌
- `AntiCusp_Lambda10_SM0.10_LC10.0_EE0.0038_Cusps2_Jerk20.6.mp4` ❌
- `HighRes_MaxSmooth_SM0.10_LC1.5_EE0.0038_Cusps2_Jerk20.6.mp4` ❌

**Recommendation:** Regenerate all animations with the fix.

### Visual Symptoms in Buggy Animations:
- Red dot (Stage C ref EE) starts correctly but quickly lags behind
- By mid-trajectory, red dot can be 10+ frames behind the robot
- Green square (actual EE) is always correct (computed in real-time from robot pose)
- This makes it LOOK like the robot is not tracking the red reference, but it's just a visualization bug!

---

## Testing the Fix

### Test Script Created:
`test_animation_sync_fix.m` - Regenerates one animation to verify the fix

### Verification Checklist:
When reviewing the fixed animation, confirm:
- ✅ Red dot moves in sync with robot motion
- ✅ Red dot starts immediately when robot starts moving (not lagging)
- ✅ Green square (actual EE) tracks the red dot smoothly
- ✅ EE position error display is accurate throughout

---

## Regeneration Plan

To get corrected animations:

### Option 1: Quick Single Animation
```matlab
% Load a specific result
load('results/parametric_study_20251011_085252/parametric_study_results.mat');
gik9dof.animateStagedWithHelper(results(1).log, ...
    'ExportVideo', 'results/parametric_study_20251011_085252/animations/Baseline_FIXED.mp4', ...
    'FrameRate', 20, 'SampleStep', 2);
```

### Option 2: Regenerate All 5 Animations
```matlab
matlab -batch "generate_parametric_animations"
```
This will overwrite the existing animations with synchronized versions (~11 minutes).

---

## Technical Details

### Why This Bug is Subtle:
1. **Green square is correct:** The actual EE marker is computed in real-time from the robot's current configuration, so it's always synchronized
2. **Error display is correct:** EE position error is computed using the correctly-indexed `stageCFull`, not the buggy `eePoses`
3. **Only red dot is wrong:** The red reference marker uses `eePoses` which has the indexing bug

### Why It Wasn't Caught Earlier:
- The bug only affects visualization, not actual tracking performance
- Metrics (EE error, cusps, jerk) are all computed correctly from logs
- The green square (actual EE) looks correct, masking the red dot issue
- With `SampleStep=1` (no sampling), the bug doesn't manifest

### Code Flow:
```
runStagedReference()
  └─> log.qTraj (full trajectory, e.g., 500 frames)
      log.stageLogs.stageC.referenceInitialIk.eePositions (500 frames)
      
animateStagedWithHelper(log, 'SampleStep', 2)
  ├─> armTrajectory = qTraj(:, 1:2:end)  → [1,3,5,...,499] (250 frames)
  ├─> basePose = qTraj(:, 1:2:end)       → [1,3,5,...,499] (250 frames)
  └─> eePoses = eePathStageCRef(:, 1:2:end)' 
      BEFORE FIX: → [1,5,9,...] (125 frames) ❌ WRONG LENGTH!
      AFTER FIX:  → [1,3,5,...,499] (250 frames) ✅ CORRECT!
```

**Primary Fix:**
- File: `matlab/+gik9dof/animateStagedWithHelper.m`
- Lines: 50-56
- Commit: (to be committed)

**Animation Rendering:**
- File: `matlab/+gik9dof/+viz/animate_whole_body.m`
- Lines: 463-471 (red dot update loop)
- This code is correct; it was getting bad input from animateStagedWithHelper

**EE Path Computation:**
- File: `matlab/+gik9dof/animateStagedWithHelper.m`
- Lines: 141-147 (`computeEEPath` function)
- This function is correct; just needs to be called with properly sampled data

## Additional Notes

### SampleStep Parameter:
- **Purpose:** Reduce animation file size and generation time by skipping frames
- **Typical values:** 1 (no skip), 2 (every other frame), 3 (every 3rd frame)
- **Current parametric study:** `SampleStep=2` (50% reduction)
- **Recommendation:** Keep `SampleStep=2` for reasonable file sizes (~9.5MB)

### FrameRate Parameter:
- **Purpose:** Video playback speed (fps)
- **Current parametric study:** `FrameRate=20` (20 fps)
- **Note:** Higher frame rate = smoother but larger files
- **Recommendation:** 20 fps is good balance for review

## Summary

**Issue:** Red EE reference marker (red dot) lagged behind robot due to double-sampling bug  
**Fix:** Conditional sampling - only sample once depending on source  
**Impact:** Visual only - metrics were always correct  
**Action:** Regenerate animations for accurate visualization  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** (2025-10-11)
