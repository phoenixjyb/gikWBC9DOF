# Merge Session Summary - Quick Reference

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Session**: Merge origin/main into codegencc45  
**Result**: ✅ **Success - No integration work needed**

---

## TL;DR

**What happened**: Merged 43 MATLAB files from origin/main. Analysis revealed Pure Pursuit C++ wrapper was **unchanged** - previous work already had all features. ROS2 integration already correct. No rebuilds needed.

**Action required**: ❌ None for Pure Pursuit  
**Future work**: GIK multi-constraint support (deferred)

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Pure Pursuit ✅
- **MATLAB class**: 254 lines refactored (simulation improvements)
- **C++ wrapper**: UNCHANGED (already had advanced features)
- **ROS2 integration**: Already correct, all 13 parameters match
- **Action**: None - system ready as-is

### 2. GIK Multi-Constraint ⏳
- **MATLAB**: Multi-constraint support added
- **C++**: Still uses single constraint (older interface)
- **Required**: Yes (production feature)
- **Timeline**: Deferred to future session (~11 hours)

## What Changed in Merge

| Component | Change | Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `purePursuitFollower.m` | 254 lines | MATLAB simulation only |
| `purePursuitVelocityController.m` | **0 lines** | C++ wrapper unchanged |
| `createGikSolver.m` | +multi-constraint | C++ regen needed (deferred) |
| Codegen artifacts | Cleanup | None |
| Test scripts | New tools | MATLAB testing improvements |

---

## Why No C++ Updates Needed

The wrapper function (`purePursuitVelocityController.m`) that generates C++ code:
- Was created in earlier commit `e258c2c` 
- Already had all advanced features (path buffer, adaptive lookahead, etc.)
- Completely unchanged in this merge
- ROS2 node already configured with correct parameters

The MATLAB class refactoring only improved **simulation/testing** capabilities, not the C++ codegen layer.

## Architecture Layers

```
MATLAB Simulation (purePursuitFollower.m)
    ↓ [Changed - 254 lines]
    ↓ [Used for testing only]
    
C++ Codegen Wrapper (purePursuitVelocityController.m)
    ↓ [UNCHANGED - 0 lines]
    ↓ [Already had all features]
    
ROS2 Integration (stage_b_chassis_plan.cpp)
    ↓ [No changes needed]
    ↓ [Already has correct params]
```

## Next Session

When you return to this work:

1. **Optional**: Test Pure Pursuit mode 2 in simulation
2. **When ready**: Implement GIK multi-constraint support
   - Regenerate C++ from `createGikSolver.m`
   - Update ROS2 integration
   - Test multi-constraint scenarios

## Commands Run

```powershell
# Merge
git merge origin/main
git rm <conflicted-files>  # 7 rename/delete conflicts
git commit

# Analysis
git diff codegencc45-backup HEAD -- matlab/purePursuitVelocityController.m
# Result: Empty (no changes)

# Codegen (ran, but produced identical output)
matlab -batch "run('generate_code_purePursuit.m')"
```
