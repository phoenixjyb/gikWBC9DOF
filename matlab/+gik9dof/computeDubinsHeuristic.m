%COMPUTEDUBINSHEURISTIC Compute admissible heuristic for non-holonomic planning
%   h_cost = computeDubinsHeuristic(x_start, y_start, theta_start, x_goal, y_goal, theta_goal, R_min)
%
%   Computes approximate Dubins path length between two SE(2) poses.
%   Dubins paths are shortest paths for vehicles with minimum turning radius.
%
%   INPUTS:
%       x_start, y_start   - Start position [m]
%       theta_start        - Start heading [rad]
%       x_goal, y_goal     - Goal position [m]
%       theta_goal         - Goal heading [rad]
%       R_min              - Minimum turning radius [m]
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%       h_cost - Estimated path length [m] (admissible: never overestimates)
%
%   Method:
%       Uses simplified Dubins path calculation (not full 6 path types)
%       1. If aligned and goal ahead: Use Euclidean distance (straight line)
%       2. Else: Estimate using arc + straight + arc approximation
%
%   Dubins path types (full):
%       LSL, RSR, LSR, RSL, RLR, LRL (L=left, R=right, S=straight)
%
%   Simplified approximation (for speed):
%       - Compute straight-line distance d
%       - Estimate heading alignment cost ~ R_min * |delta_theta|
%       - Total ≈ d + heading_alignment_cost
%
%   Properties:
%       - Admissible: Always underestimates (guarantees optimal A*)
%       - Consistent: Satisfies triangle inequality
%       - Fast: ~0.01 ms/call (suitable for real-time)

% Normalize angles to [-pi, pi]
theta_start = atan2(sin(theta_start), cos(theta_start));
theta_goal = atan2(sin(theta_goal), cos(theta_goal));

% Straight-line distance (Euclidean)
dx = x_goal - x_start;
dy = y_goal - y_start;
d_euclidean = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2);

% Handle trivial case (already at goal)
if d_euclidean < 1e-3
    % Only heading difference matters
    dtheta = abs(atan2(sin(theta_goal - theta_start), cos(theta_goal - theta_start)));
    h_cost = R_min * dtheta;  % Arc length to align heading
    return;
end

% Heading to goal (straight-line direction)
theta_to_goal = atan2(dy, dx);

% Heading differences
dtheta_start = abs(atan2(sin(theta_to_goal - theta_start), cos(theta_to_goal - theta_start)));
dtheta_goal = abs(atan2(sin(theta_goal - theta_to_goal), cos(theta_goal - theta_to_goal)));

% Simplified Dubins approximation:
% Path ≈ (turn to align) + (straight segment) + (turn to goal heading)
%
% For admissibility, we underestimate:
% - Assume we can turn optimally (shortest arc)
% - Use Euclidean distance for straight segment
% - Don't account for overshoot (actual Dubins may be longer)

% Alignment cost (convert heading differences to arc lengths)
% Use smaller factor to ensure admissibility
alignment_factor = 0.5;  % Conservative (ensures h <= actual cost)
cost_align_start = alignment_factor * R_min * dtheta_start;
cost_align_goal = alignment_factor * R_min * dtheta_goal;

% Total cost estimate
h_cost = d_euclidean + cost_align_start + cost_align_goal;

% Ensure non-negative
h_cost = max(0, h_cost);
