## UPDATE: âœ… CODEGEN COMPLETE!

**Date:** 2025-10-08 03:56
**Commit:** eca3591

Successfully regenerated C++ code for both ARM64 and x64 after debugging MATLAB Coder type issues.

**Root Cause:** Merge brought uint32 state variables, but codegen type specs defined them as double.

**Fixes:**
- Cast pathBufferSize to uint32
- Initialize numToRemove as uint32(0)
- Fix state_type.numWaypoints to uint32

**Generated:**
- ARM64: matlab/codegen/purepursuit_arm64/
- x64: matlab/codegen/purepursuit_x64/

**Verified:** Generated C++ has complete bidirectional support matching ROS2 implementation.

See PUREPURSUIT_CODEGEN_SUCCESS.md for full details.
