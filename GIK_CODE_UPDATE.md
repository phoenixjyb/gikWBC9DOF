# GIK Solver Code Update - October 9, 2025

## Problem
After deploying to Orin, build failed with namespace errors in GIK solver code:
```
error: 'gik9dof_codegen_inuse_solveGIKStepWrapper_nestLockGlobal' was not declared in this scope
error: 'robotics' in namespace 'coder' does not name a type
error: 'isInitialized_gik9dof_codegen_inuse_solveGIKStepWrapper' was not declared in this scope
```

## Root Cause
The ROS2 package had **old backup GIK code** in `matlab_codegen/include/` instead of the production ARM64 code.

The deployment script transferred `ros2/gik9dof_solver/matlab_codegen/` which contained outdated generated code, not the fresh ARM64 real-time code from `codegen/arm64_realtime/`.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Local: Replace old code with production ARM64
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force ros2\gik9dof_solver\matlab_codegen\include\*
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force codegen\arm64_realtime\* ros2\gik9dof_solver\matlab_codegen\include\
```

**Result**: 196 ARM64 generated files copied

### 2. Orin: Deploy production ARM64 GIK code
```bash
# Clear old code
ssh cr@192.168.100.150 "rm -rf /home/nvidia/temp_gikrepo/ros2/gik9dof_solver/matlab_codegen/include/*"

# Transfer production ARM64 code
wsl rsync -avz --progress codegen/arm64_realtime/ \
  cr@192.168.100.150:/home/nvidia/temp_gikrepo/ros2/gik9dof_solver/matlab_codegen/include/
```

**Result**: 206 files transferred (196 source + subdirectories)

## Production ARM64 Code Features
- âœ… MaxTime=50ms for real-time performance
- âœ… Linux MATLAB R2024a generation
- âœ… Proper namespace handling (`gik9dof::`)
- âœ… 20 constraints (full 9-DOF + distance bounds)
- âœ… Generated: Oct 9, 2025 12:08:20

## Now Ready to Build on Orin

```bash
cd /home/nvidia/temp_gikrepo/ros2
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_solver
```

Should compile successfully with both:
- âœ… **GIK Solver**: ARM64, MaxTime=50ms, 20 constraints
- âœ… **Planner**: Linux MATLAB `planHybridAStarCodegen`

Native ARM64 compilation will happen during build! ðŸš€
