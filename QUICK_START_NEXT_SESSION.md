# QUICK START - Next Conversation Round

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

The namespace conflict has been successfully resolved! All wrapper functions have been implemented and the package builds cleanly.

## What Was Completed âœ…

1. âœ… Added 4 wrapper function declarations to `stage_b_factory.hpp`
2. âœ… Implemented wrapper functions in `stage_b_chassis_plan.cpp`
3. âœ… Updated node to use wrapper functions instead of direct method calls
4. âœ… Clean build with no namespace conflicts

## Build Result

```bash
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_solver --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
âœ… Finished <<< gik9dof_solver [2min 44s]
```

## What to Do Next

### 1. Test the ROS2 Node
```bash
cd ros2
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run gik9dof_solver gik9dof_solver_node --ros-args --params-file src/gik9dof_solver/config/gik9dof_solver.yaml
```

### 2. Verify Stage Transitions
- Send a goal pose via ROS2 topic
- Monitor log output for stage transitions (A â†’ B â†’ C)
- Check that chassis planning works in Stage B

### 3. Integration Testing
- Test with actual robot or simulation
- Verify base velocity commands are published
- Validate arm commands during staged control

## Implementation Details

### Wrapper Functions Created

Four wrapper functions now allow the main node to interact with Stage B controller without including conflicting headers:

1. **`stageBActivate`** - Activate Stage B with current/goal poses
2. **`stageBExecuteStep`** - Execute one control step
3. **`stageBChassisReachedGoal`** - Check if goal reached
4. **`stageBDeactivate`** - Deactivate controller

### Files Modified

- `stage_b_factory.hpp` - Added wrapper declarations
- `stage_b_chassis_plan.cpp` - Implemented wrappers
- `gik9dof_solver_node.cpp` - Updated to use wrappers

## Documentation

See `NAMESPACE_CONFLICT_RESOLVED.md` for complete technical details and architecture explanation.

## If Issues Arise

1. Check `NAMESPACE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` for full technical background
2. Verify all includes in node are correct
3. Ensure Stage B library is properly linked in CMakeLists.txt

**Status: READY FOR TESTING** ðŸš€


## Expected Result
âœ… Clean build (no namespace conflicts)  
âœ… All tests pass  
âœ… Ready to deploy

## Estimated Time
15-20 minutes

## If stuck
Check `NAMESPACE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` for full technical explanation.
