# WSL Validation - Step-by-Step Guide

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Platform**: WSL Ubuntu 22.04 (x86_64)  
**Goal**: Validate C++ IK solver on native x86_64 architecture

## Prerequisites Check

✅ You already have:
- WSL Ubuntu 22.04 installed
- ROS2 Humble configured
- Solver built and working on WSL

## Quick Start (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Open WSL Terminal

```powershell
# In Windows PowerShell
wsl
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Project

```bash
cd ~/gikWBC9DOF
# Or if project is on Windows drive:
cd /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF
```

### Step 3: Copy Test Files to WSL

**Option A: From Windows (PowerShell)**:
```powershell
# Copy the test script
wsl cp /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/validation/run_cpp_test_wsl.py ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/

# Copy MATLAB reference data
wsl cp /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/validation/matlab_reference_results.json ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/

# Make script executable
wsl chmod +x ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/run_cpp_test_wsl.py
```

**Option B: From WSL**:
```bash
# Create validation directory
mkdir -p ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation

# Copy files from Windows
cp /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/validation/run_cpp_test_wsl.py ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/
cp /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/validation/matlab_reference_results.json ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/run_cpp_test_wsl.py
```

### Step 4: Start the Solver Node

**Terminal 1 (WSL)**:
```bash
cd ~/gikWBC9DOF
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/gikWBC9DOF/ros2/install/setup.bash
ros2 run gik9dof_solver gik9dof_solver_node
```

Expected output:
```
[INFO] [gik9dof_solver_node]: GIK 9-DOF Solver Node initialized
[INFO] [gik9dof_solver_node]: Control rate: 10.0 Hz
[INFO] [gik9dof_solver_node]: Solver ready
```

### Step 5: Run the Validation Test

**Terminal 2 (new WSL session)**:
```bash
cd ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/gikWBC9DOF/ros2/install/setup.bash
python3 run_cpp_test_wsl.py
```

Expected output:
```
============================================================
C++ WSL x86_64 Solver Validation Test
============================================================

Step 1: Loading MATLAB reference from ...
  ✅ Loaded 20 waypoints

Step 2: Initializing ROS2 node...
Step 3: Waiting for solver node...
  Publishing initial robot state...
  ✅ Initial state published

Step 4: Testing 20 waypoints...
  Progress: 1....5....10....15....20  DONE

Step 5: Computing summary statistics...
  Success rate: XX/20 (XX.X%)
  Solve time: XX.XX ms (avg)

Step 6: Saving results to ...
  ✅ Results saved (XX.X KB)

============================================================
✅ C++ WSL x86_64 Solver Test Complete
============================================================
```

## Expected Results

### If Everything Works (Expected) ✅

**Success Rate**: Should match MATLAB (~10% with strict parameters) or better

**Terminal 1 Output**:
```
[INFO] [gik9dof_solver_node]: ✅ Arm state received and set!
[INFO] [gik9dof_solver_node]: ✅ Base odom received and set!
[INFO] [gik9dof_solver_node]: Received trajectory with 1 waypoints, seq=1
[INFO] [gik9dof_solver_node]: IK solved in XX ms
[INFO] [gik9dof_solver_node]: Received trajectory with 1 waypoints, seq=2
...
```

**Output Files**:
```bash
ls -lh ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/
# Should show:
# matlab_reference_results.json  (27 KB - MATLAB x86_64 results)
# cpp_wsl_results.json           (27 KB - C++ WSL x86_64 results)
```

### If It Hangs (Would Indicate Broader Issue) ⚠️

If WSL also hangs like ARM64:
- Problem is in MATLAB codegen, not ARM64-specific
- Would need to debug solver parameters
- **Unlikely** - WSL has same architecture as MATLAB

## Copy Results Back to Windows

```bash
# From WSL, copy to Windows validation folder
cp ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/cpp_wsl_results.json /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/validation/
```

Or from Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
wsl cp ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/cpp_wsl_results.json /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/validation/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Reference file not found"

```bash
# Check where the file is
ls -lh /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/validation/matlab_reference_results.json

# Copy it if needed
cp /mnt/c/Users/yanbo/wSpace/codegenGIKsample/Trial/gikWBC9DOF/validation/matlab_reference_results.json ~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/
```

### Issue: "No module named 'rclpy'"

```bash
# Make sure ROS2 is sourced
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/gikWBC9DOF/ros2/install/setup.bash

# Verify ROS2 is available
ros2 --version
```

### Issue: "gik9dof_solver_node not found"

```bash
# Rebuild if needed
cd ~/gikWBC9DOF/ros2
colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_solver

# Source again
source install/setup.bash
```

### Issue: "Connection refused" or "No topics"

```bash
# Check if solver is running
ros2 node list
# Should show: /gik9dof_solver_node

# Check topics
ros2 topic list
# Should show trajectory and feedback topics
```

## What This Proves

### ✅ Success on WSL = Good News!

**Proves**:
- ✅ MATLAB→C++ codegen is correct
- ✅ Solver algorithm works in C++
- ✅ ROS2 integration is sound
- ✅ x86_64 numerical behavior is as expected

**Conclusion**:
- ARM64 hang is architecture-specific (SSE stubs or FP differences)
- Not a fundamental solver problem
- ARM64 needs proper NEON implementation or different approach

### ⚠️ Failure on WSL = Unexpected!

**Would indicate**:
- Problem in MATLAB codegen or solver parameters
- Not ARM64-specific
- Would need to debug codegen settings

**Next steps**:
- Review solver parameters
- Check MATLAB Coder settings
- May need to regenerate code

## Next Phase: Comparison Analysis

After successful WSL test, proceed to **Phase 4**:

1. **Run MATLAB comparison script** (to be created):
   ```matlab
   cd matlab/validation
   compare_results
   ```

2. **Review comparison report**:
   - `validation/validation_comparison.json`
   - Joint configuration differences
   - Solve time comparison
   - Success rate analysis

3. **Generate final report**:
   - MATLAB vs C++ x86_64 validation complete
   - Document ARM64 as "known issue - SSE compatibility"
   - Recommend x86_64 deployment or ARM64 alternative

## Timeline

- **Setup**: 5 minutes (copy files, open terminals)
- **Test execution**: 2-3 minutes (20 waypoints)
- **Analysis**: 10 minutes (Phase 4 comparison)
- **Total**: ~20 minutes end-to-end

## Files Created

**On Windows**:
- `validation/run_cpp_test_wsl.py` ✅

**On WSL** (after execution):
- `~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/matlab_reference_results.json` (copied)
- `~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/run_cpp_test_wsl.py` (copied)
- `~/gikWBC9DOF/validation/cpp_wsl_results.json` (generated) ⭐

**Back on Windows** (after copy):
- `validation/cpp_wsl_results.json` (for comparison)

## Ready?

You're all set! Just follow Steps 1-5 above to run the WSL validation.

Would you like me to wait while you run it, or do you have any questions first?

## Performance Optimization Update (Oct 7, 2025)

🚀 **Major optimization changes implemented!**

After analyzing the CPU usage patterns on ARM64, we discovered the solver was working correctly but **without performance constraints**. The following optimizations have been implemented:

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ **Solver timeout**: `MaxTime = 50ms`
2. ✅ **Iteration limit**: `MaxIterations = 50`
3. ✅ **ARM64 NEON**: Configured for ARM SIMD (not x86 SSE)
4. ✅ **Warm-start**: Use previous solution as initial guess
5. ✅ **ROS2 timeout monitoring**: Logs if solver exceeds 50ms

### Expected Improvements:
- Solve time: **10-50ms** (vs unbounded before)
- Iterations: **10-30** average (vs 50+ before)
- CPU usage: **20-40%** per solve (more consistent)
- Success rate: **>95%** for smooth trajectories

### For Details:
See **`PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md`** in the project root for:
- Complete explanation of changes
- Deployment instructions
- Parameter tuning guide
- Troubleshooting tips

**To deploy these optimizations:**
1. Regenerate code: `RUN_CODEGEN` in MATLAB
2. Rebuild on Orin: `colcon build --packages-select gik9dof_solver`
3. Monitor performance: Check diagnostics topic
