# Pure Pursuit & Chassis Control Implementation Inventory
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** Audit of existing implementations before attempting new codegen

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **YOU ALREADY HAVE A WORKING C++ PURE PURSUIT CONTROLLER!**

The `purePursuitVelocityController` is already code-generated and deployed in your ROS2 system. You **do not need** to generate chassis controller code - the pure pursuit functionality is already available in C++.

## 2. MATLAB Implementations

### A. Codegen-Compatible Version: `matlab/purePursuitVelocityController.m`

**Status:** ✅ **CODEGEN-READY** (already used to generate C++)

**Function Signature:**
```matlab
function [vx, wz, stateOut] = purePursuitVelocityController(...
    refX, refY, refTheta, refTime, ...
    estX, estY, estYaw, ...
    params, ...
    stateIn)
```

**Properties:**
- ❌ No `arguments` block (codegen compatible!)
- ❌ No `inputParser` (codegen compatible!)
- ✅ Plain struct inputs
- ✅ 359 lines, fully functional
- ✅ Source for existing C++ code in ROS2

**This is the implementation that generated your working C++ code!**

---

### B. Class-Based Version: `matlab/+gik9dof/+control/purePursuitFollower.m`

**Status:** ❌ **NOT CODEGEN-COMPATIBLE** (class with `inputParser`)

**Class Definition:**
```matlab
classdef purePursuitFollower < handle
    methods
        function obj = purePursuitFollower(pathStates, varargin)
            parser = inputParser;  % ← NOT CODEGEN-COMPATIBLE
            ...
        end
    end
end
```

**Properties:**
- ❌ Uses `inputParser` in constructor (line 57)
- ❌ Class-based OOP (not codegen-friendly)
- ❌ Name-value argument parsing
- ✅ 338 lines, feature-rich
- ❌ Cannot be directly code-generated

**This is the problematic version that blocked chassis controller codegen!**

---

### C. New Functions from origin/main

**Recently merged from origin/main:**

1. **`simulateChassisController.m`** (328 lines)
   - ❌ Has `arguments` block
   - ❌ Delegates to class-based purePursuitFollower for mode 2
   - ✅ Has simple inline implementations for modes 0, 1
   - Status: Wrapper created but blocked by dependency

2. **`simulatePurePursuitExecution.m`** (83 lines)
   - ❌ Has `arguments` block
   - ❌ Creates purePursuitFollower class instance
   - Status: Not codegen-compatible

3. **`rsClothoidRefine.m`** (204 lines)
   - ❌ Has `arguments` block
   - ✅ Wrapper created: `rsClothoidRefineCodegen.m`
   - Status: Wrapper ready, not yet tested

---

## 3. Attempted New Codegen (Currently Blocked)

### chassis_controller_arm64/
- **Status:** ❌ Failed - directory exists but empty (1 error file)
- **Blocker:** `purePursuitFollower` class uses `inputParser`
- **Attempt:** Created `simulateChassisControllerCodegen.m` wrapper
- **Result:** Wrapper bypasses `arguments` block, but hits class dependency

### rs_smoothing_arm64/
- **Status:** ⚠️ Not attempted yet (directory empty)
- **Wrapper:** `rsClothoidRefineCodegen.m` created
- **Next Step:** Ready to try after resolving strategy

---

## 4. Analysis & Recommendations

### Key Finding

**You already have everything you need for pure pursuit control in C++!**

The `purePursuitVelocityController` (top-level MATLAB function) was specifically designed to be codegen-compatible and is **already deployed in your ROS2 system**. It has:

✅ No `arguments` blocks  
✅ No `inputParser`  
✅ No classes  
✅ Plain struct-based API  
✅ **Already generating working C++ code**

### The Problem

The new code from origin/main (`simulateChassisController`, `purePursuitFollower` class) uses **modern MATLAB features** (arguments validation, classes, inputParser) that are **not codegen-compatible**. These were likely designed for:
- MATLAB simulation and testing
- Rapid prototyping
- Not intended for C++ code generation

### Options Going Forward

**Option A: Use What You Have** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Action:** Declare victory - your C++ pure pursuit already works
- **Codegen:** Stop trying to generate chassis_controller_arm64
- **Result:** Clean, working system with proven C++ code
- **Effort:** Zero additional work

**Option B: Try RS Smoothing Only**
- **Action:** Attempt to generate rs_smoothing_arm64 using the wrapper
- **Risk:** May hit similar dependency issues
- **Value:** Path smoothing could be useful
- **Effort:** 1 attempt (wrapper already created)

**Option C: Major Rewrite** ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**
- **Action:** Rewrite simulateChassisController for codegen
- **Scope:** Extract modes 0, 1 only (skip class-based mode 2)
- **Result:** Partial functionality, significant work
- **Effort:** High, with uncertain value

## 7. Recommendation

**STOP TRYING TO CODEGEN CHASSIS CONTROLLER** ✅

You already have:
- ✅ Working C++ pure pursuit controller
- ✅ Deployed in ROS2
- ✅ Fully integrated
- ✅ Bidirectional (forward/reverse)
- ✅ Battle-tested

The new MATLAB functions from origin/main are:
- 📝 Great for MATLAB simulation
- 📝 Useful for prototyping
- 📝 Not designed for codegen
- 📝 Redundant for C++ deployment

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Document this analysis (this file)
2. ✅ Clean up failed codegen attempts (remove empty directories)
3. ⚠️ Optionally try RS smoothing codegen (low priority)
4. ✅ Update integration documentation with findings
5. ✅ Commit and close this codegen exploration

---

## 8. Questions to Answer

Before proceeding, clarify:

1. **Do you need RS smoothing in C++?** 
   - What's the use case?
   - Is MATLAB simulation sufficient?

2. **What was the goal of chassis controller codegen?**
   - You already have pure pursuit in C++
   - What additional functionality was needed?

3. **Should we keep the class-based MATLAB versions?**
   - They're good for simulation
   - But redundant with working C++ code
